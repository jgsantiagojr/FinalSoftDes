### _How It Came To Be_
Sometime around mid 2019, 4 engineering students came up with a crazy idea.... but before we go into that lets start at the beginning.
Mason was born first in 1999, Jerry, Skye and Jamie came next, in that order. All four of them, grew up, not knowing each other, or the impact they would have on the world of PC gaming.
As they grew up, living their individual stories, they developed a sense of self and personality, and despite various adversities, prospered until their tales met, at Olin College of Engineering. 
In their Software Design class, second semester, they were tasked with a final project, it was completely open-ended and the world was their oyester. But they all knew what had to be done...... __a game__. A game better than any other game. 
They knew they wanted to make a game, but they had to decide what kind. After some conversation, it was clear, the game would be a 2D Platformer and have some basis in the knew
